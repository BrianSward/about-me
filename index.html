      <p>Hello my name is Brian Sward. I am a veteran of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>. I have lived in three different countries and seven different states. I currenlty live in Seattle, Washington.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_University">Wesleyan University</a> in Middletown, Connecticut with a degree in theoretical maths. My favorite math fields are topology and graph theory, although I do quite enjoy analysis and being terrible at combinitorics. I enjoy math as it is the formal study of puzzle solving in abstract spaces each with thier own properties.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Through my life I have had various jobs but some of my highlights are my 9 years as an educator, the two years I ran a soup kitchen, my time in the military, and my almost 8 years as a minority owner of my own cannabis company.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My goals are to be able to couple my ability in math with programming languages to access data across the web and find neat ways to visualize it. For example, when I got my dog, the simple answer of how much to feed it was difficult to determine based upon available information. To be able to scrap information like kcal/g of petfoods via webscraping devices would allow me to create user interactable databases where individuals can input thier dogs age, weight, level of activity, and dog food choice. The user would then recieve an output of the amount of g/day required to maintain an animals current weight. You know, just as an example...</p>

      <p>This is Chickpea (you should get used to seeing her as I will work her photos into anything I can). She and I are best buddies.</p>
